**Mastodonte** is a Python toolkit for working with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) data.
It leverages the [Official Mastodon APIs](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/) to provide an easy-to-use set of Python methods for getting Mastodon data.

Mastodonte only relies on the *publicly accessible* endpoints from Mastodon and does not require any authentication for accessing public data.

Mastodonte is a work-in-progress toolkit, that currently supports the following operations:

*Instances*
- [ ] Get all information and metadata for a given instance
- [ ] Get the list of moderated servers from a given instance
- [ ] Get the list of rules of a given instance

*Timelines*
- [x]   Getting the (local) timeline of a given instance
- [x]   Include the list of users that reposted a given post
- [x]   Resume from a previous crawling
- [x]   Easy export to JSON files

*Users*
- [ ]  (Almost ready) Get the social network of a given user
